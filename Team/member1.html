	Matthew will be serving as the Team Leader, as well as providing additional software support. Outside of his classwork, his internships at Qualcomm and Shure have given him
	ample experience in System Verification and software design. On top of his engineering experiences, Matthew plays lead saxophone in the Purdue Jazz Band, and can often be
	found at the rock climbing wall when there is not an pandemic going on. He also recently bought a bass, but he's not very good at it (yet).
