This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Matthew MacLean</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/28/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 2<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Worked with the team on the Final Proposal Submission. As a team, we decided to drop our original design decision to include automatic movement of the pieces due to the limits of online work. We also changed RFID to magnetic sensors because of the financial burden of purchasing 128 RFID readers.</br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/4/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Created the team photo. Met with coures staff to go over our HW1, and sent an email to get our final changes (above) approved. Worked on improving PSSCs with the team. Filled in "Theory of Operation" and "Mechanical Constraints" sections in HW2, as well as worked with the other members on proofreading the other sections. Did some more research on possible components to be used for the design</br>
                      
					  
			<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/11/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Decided upon Hall Effect sensor and Multiplexers to use for the design, which are the DRV5013 and CD4051BE by TI, respectively. Met with course staff to finalize changes to design mentioned in Week 2, and decided to include an LCD screen in the final design to accomodate enough Hardware requirements for the design. Worked with the team to decide upon the STM32 F4 Development board for the project, as it has more than enough pins SPI/ADC/I2C support for our design, giving us some leeway on ititial implementations. Below are the other options for the Hall Effect and Multiplexer. For more on why these components were ultimately decided on, see HW4.</br>
