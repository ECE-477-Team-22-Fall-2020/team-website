            <h2>Progress Report for Matthew MacLean</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/28/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 2<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Worked with the team on the Final Proposal Submission. As a team, we decided to drop our original design decision to include automatic movement of the pieces due to the limits of online work. We also changed RFID to magnetic sensors because of the financial burden of purchasing 128 RFID readers.</br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/4/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Created the team photo. Met with coures staff to go over our HW1, and sent an email to get our final changes (above) approved. Worked on improving PSSCs with the team. Filled in "Theory of Operation" and "Mechanical Constraints" sections in HW2, as well as worked with the other members on proofreading the other sections. Did some more research on possible components to be used for the design</br>
                      
					  
			<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/11/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Decided upon Hall Effect sensor and Multiplexers to use for the design, which are the DRV5013 and CD4051BE by TI, respectively. Met with course staff to finalize changes to design mentioned in Week 2, and decided to include an LCD screen in the final design to accomodate enough Hardware requirements for the design. Worked with the team to decide upon the STM32 F4 Development board for the project, as it has more than enough pins SPI/ADC/I2C support for our design, giving us some leeway on ititial implementations. Below are the other options for the Hall Effect and Multiplexer. For more on why these components were ultimately decided on, see HW4.</br>

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/18/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Implemented a basic LED blinking program on the STM32F4 development board (see "SMAT Week 1" under "Media"). This was done using the System Workbench IDE. Ordered Hall effect sensors, magnets, and multiplexers for testing. Attempted to go to the ECE Store to pick up parts, but was unsuccessful due to inventory. Completed the Electrical Overview homework, including finding the current draw by the design, as well as the voltage and system clock required for the design, which were 340mA, 3.3V, and 16MHz, respectively. Below, find the block diagram for the design.

			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 9/25/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Assembled and programmed a system for determining the polarity and presence of a magnet using a Hall Effect Sensor placed above it. The sensor's analog output is read by the ADC of the STM32, and the 12-bit output
			is compared to previously determined integers to see whether it is noise, positive magnet polarity, or negative magnet polarity. Based on some rudimentary testing with the single Hall Effect sensor and a magnet, when the ADC
			reads below 200 it is negative polarity, and when it reads above 2000 it is a positive polarity. Those ranges will be reevaluated once more Hall Effect sensors to account for individual differences in sensors. After verifying
			that one Hall Effect sensor could accurately determine the team of a piece, a schematic was created for a 3x3 network of Hall Effect sensors, to be implemeted and tested soon. Below can be found both the code used to initialize
			and run the ADC during the single sensor tests, as well as the schematic for the 3x3 network.

			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/02/2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Constructed the test circuit for the 3x3 network of Hall Effect sensors detailed in the schematic from Week 5. Some introductory code was written to scan through the 9 sensors, and determine the polarity/presence of the
			magnet at that location, which was based heavily off of the function written for last week's code. The 2000 and 200 value limits were reused as the conditions for the sensors have not yet changed, but they may change
			once the system is mounted under a chess board. The demonstration of this system working was used as the Show Me A Thing for this week as well. Code was also begun for determining the changes in board state from one move
			to the next. A Piece structure was created in C with two character attributes inside. One will be used to determine the type of piece it is, with the other determining the the team of the piece. A 2d array of these structures
			will be created and subsequently prepared with the incoming values of the Hall Effect Sensors to determine when and where a piece has moved, and the array will be updated accordingly. Below, find the beginnings of the code
			that will be used for this comaprison, as well as a picture of the physical circuit used for the 3x3 testing.
