This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Dan Burger</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> August 28, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						Our team met to revise our initial project proposal given the current situation due to COVID-19. This includes
						but is not limited to having extremely limited access to the lab, remote learning, as well as having one of our
						team members working with us from a different state. We scaled back the project so that it would not be as mechanically
						complicated to build. We decided on a set of PSSCs to define the goals of our project.
            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 4, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						This week, I met with our group to talk about some issues we had with our project, review our graded documents, and begin
						investigating parts we may need for Socially Distanced Chess. We decided on Hall effect sensors to be used in piece format-detection
						with software keeping track of initial positions and where pieces moved to determine current positions. We started moving away from Bluetooth
						as we were advised by a course staff that this may be difficult.											
						<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 11, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						After having a helpful conversation with course staff during our assigned lab time, our team had a much better idea on what direction we wanted to take our Social Distancing Chess project. I aided in exploring different microcontroller options by researching various STM32 F series microcontrollers with a team member and this led discussions on which version would fit our project the best. We chose the STM 32 F-4.
						<br>
						<br>
						Since we changed our PSSCs to fulfill the 3 hardware requirements by including Bluetooth, I researched what Bluetooth modules are available to use with an STM 32 F-4 and which ones would have the features needed to connect our boards with any player’s smartphone. After sifting through obscure and outdated Bluetooth components, I found that the HC-05 and HC-06 modules were by far the most popular. I prioritized popularity over raw speed or capability simply because we have been warned how troublesome Bluetooth can be to work with so we want as many online resources as we can get. The HC-05 and HC-06 are fairly identical besides the fact that HC-06 has fewer pins and the HC-05 can act as both a slave and master. We chose the HC-05 due to its ability to be both slave and master in case we want iterations of our project that don’t require a cell phone while the boards are in close proximity to each other.
