            <h2>Progress Report for Dan Burger</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> August 28, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						Our team met to revise our initial project proposal given the current situation due to COVID-19. This includes
						but is not limited to having extremely limited access to the lab, remote learning, as well as having one of our
						team members working with us from a different state. We scaled back the project so that it would not be as mechanically
						complicated to build. We decided on a set of PSSCs to define the goals of our project.
            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 4, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						This week, I met with our group to talk about some issues we had with our project, review our graded documents, and begin
						investigating parts we may need for Socially Distanced Chess. We decided on Hall effect sensors to be used in piece format-detection
						with software keeping track of initial positions and where pieces moved to determine current positions. We started moving away from Bluetooth
						as we were advised by a course staff that this may be difficult.											
						<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 11, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						After having a helpful conversation with course staff during our assigned lab time, our team had a much better idea on what direction we wanted to take our Social Distancing Chess project. I aided in exploring different microcontroller options by researching various STM32 F series microcontrollers with a team member and this led discussions on which version would fit our project the best. We chose the STM 32 F-4.
						<br>
						<br>
						Since we changed our PSSCs to fulfill the 3 hardware requirements by including Bluetooth, I researched what Bluetooth modules are available to use with an STM 32 F-4 and which ones would have the features needed to connect our boards with any player’s smartphone. After sifting through obscure and outdated Bluetooth components, I found that the HC-05 and HC-06 modules were by far the most popular. I prioritized popularity over raw speed or capability simply because we have been warned how troublesome Bluetooth can be to work with so we want as many online resources as we can get. The HC-05 and HC-06 are fairly identical besides the fact that HC-06 has fewer pins and the HC-05 can act as both a slave and master. We chose the HC-05 due to its ability to be both slave and master in case we want iterations of our project that don’t require a cell phone while the boards are in close proximity to each other.

						<h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 18, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						This week our team really had to start focusing on ordering parts, so I found a supplier (GetFPV) that sold the HC-05 Bluetooth module. I placed an order for two while also helping Matthew MacLean with finding good datasheets for the device. In our team’s weekly meeting, we worked on the Bill of Materials. This was a good opportunity to talk realistically about what parts we needed and I spent time searching for the part number and manufacturer for all parts we ordered thus far. We spent time discussing what chess set we wanted to buy. We are considering the idea of 3D printing the entire board but wanted a backup chess set that we could gut out the insides and fill with our electronics in case 3D printing is not an option.
						<br>
						I also spent time this week exploring both KiCAD and EAGLE software for when we have to design a PCB. As the Electrical Engineer role in the team, I would expect that responsibility to fal mostly to me. I have never worked in a PCB CAD design software before so I made sure to play around with it and become familiar with one of them.

						<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> September 24, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						This week began with me exploring some tutorials on KiCAD, and this research included attending Todd Wild’s Tuesday night Webex tutorial. This was all very helpful in understanding PCB CAD software and how we will have to design our board like the differences between a part symbol and part footprint. I was in charge of Assignment 7 which covered everything about the packaging of our project. I did plenty of research into similar commercial projects and examined how they were packaged. We chose to be inspired by certain elements of the Square Off smart chess board called the Grand Kingdom Set and an electronic board called the Gameboard-1. The Grand Kingdom Set is a fully autonomous smart chess board that connects to a smartphone with Bluetooth and has piece movement detection using pressure sensors. The Gameboard-1 is a large, flat touchscreen display that can detect both active and passive game pieces to play a variety of games by connecting to WIFI. We are borrowing the Bluetooth feature from the Square Off board and the small and sleek form factor of Gameboard-1. After this research, I used SketchUp to design a 3D model of our chess board to scale. I also sketched out the PCB layout with all of our components and where they will belong. Both of these can be seen in the images below.

						<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> October 1, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						This week I spent most of my time using KiCad to build a first draft schematic of the Social Distancing Chess board. I used the key tips I learned from Todd Wild’s tutorial to correctly place down components and connect them with wires or labels to create a clean but full schematic of all the parts and their connections. Most of the devices we are using in this project were already in the components library in KiCad (like the STM32 F4 Microcontroller, the 8:1 multiplexer, and the Hall Effect sensors). I then had to search online for the HC-05 Bluetooth module schematic and the 128 by 64 pixel OLED display schematic. I found the HC-05 schematic but could not find the OLED schematic, so Ian took some time building one from scratch. After getting valuable feedback from course staff at our lab meeting, we added a reset circuit for our microcontroller, connected the VSSA and VBAT pins on the microcontroller, attached the programming headers, added decoupling capacitors on all the ICs, and renamed the hall effect sensor matrix to match chess notation. The final result is seen in the image below.

						<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> October 9, 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
						<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
						With midterm reviews fast approaching, I have been hard at work getting our PCB design drafted and am working on finishing touches going into this following weekend. After we had our schematic approved, my team and I began assigning footprints to each of the symbols. Most of the symbols has footprints already like the STM32 F4, capacitors, resistors, switches, hall effect sensors, and multiplexers. We had to dig around the internet to find appropriate footprints for the bluetooth module and the OLED screen and driver. Once the footprints were assigned, I created the netlist and got started rearranging the parts on the pcb board. The placement of all 64 hall effect sensors and their corresponding decoupling capacitors was meticulous as they have to line up in the formation of a chess board, but the rest of the parts could be positioned in arbitrary locations at the bottom of the board (from a top-down view). After getting helpful feedback from course instructors, we have replaced the footprints of certain components and are finalizing our board with the border, screw holes, and other small details.
