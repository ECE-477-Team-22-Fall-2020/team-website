            <h2>Progress Report for Ian Haggerty</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 3 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 2<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Met with the team to determine the updated requirements for the project necessary for Homework 1. This included making the decision to drop magnetic movement of pieces, as well as made the decision to go with Hall Effect sensors to sense piece placements.
			Initialize the team github organization, allowing future work to be closely monitored by version control.

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 4 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Met with the team to determine how to respond to communicate project requirements changes to core course staff.
			Worked on generating better PSSCs, including a third hardware PSSC.
			Initialized the website GitHub repository, then ensured that the repository was initialized in the shared network folder.
			Wrote the "Functional Description" and "Thermal/Power Constraints" sections of the Functional Specification document.
			
			<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Wrote the "Screen" section of the component analysis, ultimately contributing to the decision to display moves on the screen rather than with LEDs underneath the board. This decision was made after advice from the teaching team on the Wednesday meeting.
			<br>The choice of screens was between a square LCD screen and a rectangular OLED screen. A picture of the OLED display is shown below. The OLED screen was chosen since it is better for conveying information other than a rendering of the board state;
			the board is right in front of the screen, so having a nice rendering of it didn't seem very helpful. Graphics like the one found in the example image will be used to make the UI look more complete, and a more in depth analysis of this can be found in the component analysis. A table comparing the two components is also presented in this report.

			Reduced the overlap between PSSCs, making it more clear which actual hardware model was related to each requirements. This included clearly delineating between the bluetooth communication with the bluetooth and phone, and the internet communication between each phone.

			<br><br>

			Helped arrive at the decision to use the STM32F4 microcontroller family, and picked up one to be used for the initial hardware demo coming up.

			<br>
			
            <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 18 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Assisted teammate Matthew MacLean in setting up this week's progress report demo by finding documents such as the family reference manual, helping to configure his "System Workbench for STM32" environment after some initial struggles (mine was already set up from last year, but he had switched his OS), and providing saved documents from ECE362 on fixing problems with the firmware.
			A link to the video is included below:

			Personally ordered around $180 worth of project materials. These orders were set to be delivered Friday, but this was delayed until Monday. Anticipating a delay, similar parts were looked for in the ECE parts shop. Unfortunately, the staff there were relatively unhelpful during two separate visits from Matt and I.
			The staff didn't know what Hall Effect sensors were, and were unable to find any chips in the shop which could detect a magnetic field. The staff on the second visit knew what a multiplexer was, but only knew where to find the digital ones. Part numbers were provided to them, but their catalog system seems to be in a transitionary state right now, so their searches were unsuccessful.
			One takeaway from this process was that the parts shop should really only be used for even more basic parts, like resistors and capacitors, as well as possibly some of the converters used in the voltage regulation subsystem.

			<br><br>

			The team had planned to meet on Thursday or Friday to conduct experiments using magnets, hall effect sensors, and an analog multiplexer. The goal of the testing was to see if the resistance induced by the analog multiplexer would be an issue when getting the hall effect sensor outputs. This experiment is delayed until next week, due to the delays mentioned above.
			The team has an idea of how to test these chips. The multiplexer will be bound to choose one of its lines, with the hall effect sensor on that line. A weak permanent magnet will be put in front of the hall effect sensor, and the microcontroller will attempt to read the output of the multiplexer.
			This will also be tested with two cascading multiplexers, as this might be necessary for the project. The output of the line could also be read with a voltmeter; the pins of the microcontroller in input mode are high impedence, so there wouldn't be too much of a difference.
			A lot of characterization could be done to determine an ideal magnet strength, but this initial testing is just to determine the viability of the selected multiplexer setup.

			<br><br>

			Since not much could be accomplished with hardware beyond what was shown in the above video, most of the remaining time spent was dedicated to filling out the Bill of Materials and compiling a set of references to use once the hardware arrives.
			I filled out the Microcontroller and OLED screen parts of the bill of materials, among a few other miscellaneous entries.
			I also went through and found datasheets and reference guides for the majority of our active components, putting them in the references portion of the website. This will help speed up the development process once the hardware does arrive, and having them all in one place will help when combining subsystems.
