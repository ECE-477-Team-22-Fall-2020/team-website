This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Ian Haggerty</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 3 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 2<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Met with the team to determine the updated requirements for the project necessary for Homework 1. This included making the decision to drop magnetic movement of pieces, as well as made the decision to go with Hall Effect sensors to sense piece placements.
			Initialize the team github organization, allowing future work to be closely monitored by version control.

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 4 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Met with the team to determine how to respond to communicate project requirements changes to core course staff.
			Worked on generating better PSSCs, including a third hardware PSSC.
			Initialized the website GitHub repository, then ensured that the repository was initialized in the shared network folder.
			Wrote the "Functional Description" and "Thermal/Power Constraints" sections of the Functional Specification document.
			
			<br>

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 11 September 2020<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 4<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Wrote the "Screen" section of the component analysis, ultimately contributing to the decision to display moves on the screen rather than with LEDs underneath the board. This decision was made after advice from the teaching team on the Wednesday meeting.
			<br>The choice of screens was between a square LCD screen and a rectangular OLED screen. A picture of the OLED display is shown below. The OLED screen was chosen since it is better for conveying information other than a rendering of the board state;
			the board is right in front of the screen, so having a nice rendering of it didn't seem very helpful. Graphics like the one found in the example image will be used to make the UI look more complete, and a more in depth analysis of this can be found in the component analysis. A table comparing the two components is also presented in this report.

			<br><br>

			<b>A chart comparing two display options</b>

			<br>

			Reduced the overlap between PSSCs, making it more clear which actual hardware model was related to each requirements. This included clearly delineating between the bluetooth communication with the bluetooth and phone, and the internet communication between each phone.

			<br><br>

			Helped arrive at the decision to use the STM32F4 microcontroller family, and picked up one to be used for the initial hardware demo coming up.
